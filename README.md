# APcomp
Repository for the R-based scripts used in Akabane et al. (2025)
“Vegetation and fire regimes in the Neotropics over the last 21,000 years”, Earth System Dynamics

This repository contains scripts for:

1 - Data retrieval from the Neotoma database using the neotoma2 R package. (1_Get_NeotomaData.R)
2 - Data processing, including the calculation of arboreal pollen (AP) percentages from the downloaded datasets. (2_Neotoma_data_treatment.R)
3 - Composite curve construction for defined subregions, using tools provided by the paleofire R package. (3_Paleofire_script.R)

The scripts primarily address AP calculations and composite construction, as workflows for charcoal influx data have already been well established in previous studies (e.g., Blarquez et al., 2014). In contrast, equivalent workflows for AP are rarely implemented and, to my knowledge, not yet openly available. Therefore, Step 2 bridges data downloaded in Neotoma format with the procedures commonly applied to charcoal data.

Datasets obtained from PANGAEA or manually extracted from publications are not included in the automated scripts but are also made available in this repository.

This repository also includes the main transformed and processed datasets used to generate the graphs in Akabane et al. (2025):

It contains data on charcoal influx (CHAR) and arboreal pollen (TRSH) percentages, along with their corresponding references and site locations.
Please refer to RefSupTable.csv for additional information (reference, location, site elevation, source database) and for checking the codes used for the charcoal influx files (CHAR).

Suggestions for improvement are welcome and may be incorporated into future releases.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
